			<p>Hello, my name is Imran Ilyas. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley in August of 2020. Following my undergraduate studies, I
			interned remotely full-time with start-up Next Capital Tech. as a Software Developer. I worked primarily using Python and OpenCV along
			with some Unity and C#. Unfortunately, I am not at liberty to explain exactly what I worked on and accomplished because of the NDA that I 
			signed. The internship concluded on January 31st, 2021. I elected to not re-sign as one of their Full-Time Software Developers to explore 
			the market and sharpen my own skills.</p>
			
			<p>Currently, I have been taking courses with Revature to better my Web Development skills. However, I enjoy problem-solving the most. 
			My first Computer Science undergraduate course was Problem-Solving/Problem Design with C++. Since then, I have been grinding to become
			a Software Developer/Engineer. One of these days, I'd like to try my hand at game design, but that's for another time. If you would like
			to connect with me, you may reach me through my <a href = "#contact">contact</a> below or through my 
			<a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/imran-ilyas/" target = "_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
			
		</div>

		<div id = "contact">
			Preffered form of communication is email, but phone number is in resume
			Put contact information here (Email, LinkedIn)
		
			<h1 class = "underline">Contact</h1>
			<h2 class = "underline">_______</h2>
					
			<p>Date: 02/16/2021</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Commented out beach background - begins to repeat so went with solid color background</li>
				<li>All CAPS the nav</li>
				<li>Added subheader and css to it</li>
				<li>Removed the breakline elements after the nav</li>
				<li>Adjusted the height for the header such that it fits the container i.e. 100%</li>
				<li>Should begin on working on the github.io and finishing the JS course</li>
			</ul>
